			Add more panko crumbs if mixture is still too wet to mould into shape..
			
			
		</li> <br>
	
		<li>
			Shape into burger patties about 1 inch thick..
			
			
		</li> <br>
	
		<li>
			Place patties into fry pan on medium high heat and cook one side for 2 minutes. Flip them over and cook until liquid starts to ooze out (indication of medium rare). Remove from pan and let rest for 5 more minutes before serving (to get perfect medium well). If well done is desired, turn off the heat and cover the pan for 5 minutes..
			
			
		</li> <br>
	
		<li>
			While resting aside or in the covered pan, toast burger buns in oven or another fry pan over low heat. Prepare sliced cheese, lettuce and tomato for garnishing. I also squeeze some ketchup and Japanese mayo to complete the dish. Serve and enjoy!.
